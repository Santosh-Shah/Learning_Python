# Python divides the operators in the following groups:
#
# Arithmetic operators
# x = 12
# y = 3
# print(x + y)
# print(x - y)
# print(x * y)
# print(x / y)
# print(x % y)
# print(x ** y)
# print(x // y)


# Assignment operators
# x = 5
# y = 2
# x += 3
# x *= 2
# print(x)


# Comparison operators
# x = 5
# y = 10
# print(x == y)
# print(x != y)
# print(x > y)
# print(x < y)
# print(x >= y)
# print(x <= y)

# Logical operators
# x = 10
# y = 15
# print(x < 5 and y < 100)
# print(x < 11 or y > 14)
# print(not (x > 10 and y < 13))


# Identity operators
# x = ["apple", "banana"]
# y = ["apple", "banana"]
# z = x
#
# print(x is z)
# print(x is not y)


# Membership operators
# x = ["apple", "Santosh"]
# print("Santosh" in x)
# print("apple" not in x)


# Bitwise operators
print(6 ^ 3)
print(2 & 3)
print(4 | 5)
